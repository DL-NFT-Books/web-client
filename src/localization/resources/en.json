Correctly digital, not traditional ebook stores that send the exact file clones for your money—no romance, just an attempt to make money by creating a miserable semblance of a platform. For them, books are sales fees; for the bookrypto team, they are true relations between the author and the reader.",
    "founder-description-2-abstract-2": "Secondly, I like the personality and digital properties of these books. Should one question the value of the first printed copy of 'The Lord of the Rings' to its owner or a personal copy of 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' autographed by Douglas Adams? Existing fake ebooks cannot create and convey the mentioned value. Bookrypto, I think, can.",
    "founder-description-2-abstract-3": "Thirdly, the 'book metaverse' cannot be created by the current Amazon; they need the technology the guys developed.",
    "founder-description-2-abstract-4": "P.S. The moment you enter your pixel guy for a creative evening with your favorite writer to chat with other fans and win the first edition of a new book as a result of the auction - remember how it all began."
